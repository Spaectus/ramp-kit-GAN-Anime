### Mixed Score :

```python
mixed_score = (a * IS_mean + b * FID + c * KID_mean)/(1 + d * L1_norm_interpolation) 
```

We just resolved a linear equation such that :
- a cheater generator has a mixed score of 1
- a random generator (gaussian noise) has a mixed score of 1
- `b` and `c` are negative

We then choose `b=-2`
